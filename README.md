# Wallpaper downloader using the Small Clojure Interpreter on NodeJS

A port of @yogthos's `gallery.cljs` [gist](https://gist.github.com/yogthos/d9d2324016f62d151c9843bdac3c0f23) to [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) on NodeJS.

## Why this port?

I wanted to examine the usability of [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) on NodeJS.
